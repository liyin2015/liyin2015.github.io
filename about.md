#### Welcome
Welcome to land on my personal website. I am a Computer Scientist who is in the fourth year of PhD program. Also, I am a writer (every PhD student or anyone published papers are technically writers). Also, I enjoy writing technical blogs which function as study notes for myself but also at the same time can help others to learn too. 

Currently, I am working on my first technical book series, [*The Comprehensive Coding Interview Guide*](https://github.com/liyin2015/Algorithms-and-LeetCode). More about my education and working background, please check out [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-yin-00b0456b/).  
#### Research Interests
My interestes include but not limited to: Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Segmentation (unsupervised, semantic, and instance segmentation); Drone Vision; Deep Learining (GAN, CNN); Pytorch, TensorFlow.
