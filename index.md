### Welcome to Li Sulimowicz's personal website.
## Education
PhD in Computer Science at University of Texas at Arlington, 08/2015--Present.

Bachelor of Science in Communication Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 09/2009--07/2013
## Working Experience
C++ Software Engineer at TD-Tech Ltd., 09/2013--08/2015
## Research Interest
Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Segmentation in big images
## Projects
1. Data Processing Basic software.
Realized basic machine learning algorithm using C++, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, SVM, hierarchical clustering, apriori, k-means and so on. It has a MFC interface to set up parameters. See [code](https://github.com/liyin2015/DataProc) here.
