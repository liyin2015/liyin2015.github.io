### Welcome to Li Sulimowicz's personal website.
## Introduction
This is mainly a presentation for my participated projects. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-yin-00b0456b/) for resume, [Medium](https://medium.com/@lisulimowicz) for blogs, Instagram (liyinscience) for life. 
## Research Interest
Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Segmentation (unsupervised, semantic, and instance segmentation); Drone Vision; Deep Learining (GAN, CNN); Pytorch, TensorFlow; 
## Projects
1. Data Processing Basic Software.
Realized basic machine learning algorithm using C++, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, SVM, hierarchical clustering, apriori, k-means and so on. It has a MFC interface to set up parameters. See [code](https://github.com/liyin2015/DataProc) here.

2. ROI detection in large histopathological medical images.
Proposed and implemented a coarse-to-fine multi-level unsupervised segmentation algorithm for large images.

3. Superpixel-enhanced pairiwise Conditional Random Field for Semantic Segmentation

The first pairwise fully-connected CRF model that incorporate superpixel cues. Our model has better accuracy and speed compared with corresponding conventional superpixel-based higher-order CRFs.
