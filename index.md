Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Segmentation (unsupervised, semantic, and instance segmentation); Drone Vision; Deep Learining (GAN, CNN); Pytorch, TensorFlow; 
## Projects
### Data Processing Basic Software.
Realized basic machine learning algorithm using C++, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, SVM, hierarchical clustering, apriori, k-means and so on. It has a MFC interface to set up parameters.

### Superpixel-enhanced pairiwise Conditional Random Field for Semantic Segmentation
![sp-pairwise CRF]()
The first pairwise fully-connected CRF model that incorporate superpixel cues. Our model has better accuracy and speed compared with corresponding conventional superpixel-based higher-order CRFs.
