### Welcome to Li Sulimowicz's personal website.
## Introduction
This is mainly a presentation for my participated projects. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/li-yin-00b0456b/) for resume, [Medium](https://medium.com/@lisulimowicz) for blogs, Instagram (liyinscience) for life. 
## Research Interest
Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Segmentation in big images
## Projects
1. Data Processing Basic software.
Realized basic machine learning algorithm using C++, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, SVM, hierarchical clustering, apriori, k-means and so on. It has a MFC interface to set up parameters. See [code](https://github.com/liyin2015/DataProc) here.
